    "*Zoe is singing in the background*"
    ".{w}.{w}."
    
    Zoe "Alright, Tristan Garcia--"
    Zoe "*cough* *cough*"
    Zoe "It's your turn to sing!"

    "Zoe pushes the microphone toward him with a grin"

    Tristan " M-me?"
    Tristan "No way!"
    Tristan "...{w}I cant't sing."
    Tristan "Besides, are you okay?... That's a harsh cough"

    Zoe "I'm fine... The song is just that hard."
    Zoe "With that said...{w}Everyone can sing!"
    Zoe "Besides..."
    Zoe "(Leans closer to Tristan)"
    Zoe "You owe me for losing our ice cream race...{w} hehe."
    
    Tristan "(In his head)  Why did I even agree to this date?"
    Tristan "(In his head)  I'm just embarrasing myself over and over...)"

    #  *Television static fx* 

    "Tristan flinches slightly, clutching the mic."

    Tristan "(In his head)  Again?"
    Tristan "(In his head)  Everytime I'm with her...{w} It's like...{w} The board resets."

    Zoe "Earth to Tristan!!!{p}oh no, not this again."

    Tristan "Oh...{w}sorry"
    Tristan "I'm fine, just picking a song."

    "He scrolls through the screen, fingers hovering."
    "His mind is blank...{w}until Zoe reaches over and taps a title."

    Zoe "This one!"
    Zoe "It's simple... You'll do great!"

    Tristan "I... fine."
    Tristan "But dont laugh!"

    #** Karaoke Minigame **
    # Rhythm game (Friday Night Funkin, Osu!Mania basta rhythm game na madaling ma implement HAHAHAHAHAHA)

    "As Tristan is singing...{p}Zoe smiles at him—warm, genuine, unguarded."

    # Television static fx again, but this time a flash of another memory bleeds through — the same booth, same song, same smile 

    Tristan "(In his head)  What...{w}was that?{p}A memory?..{p}A dream?.."
    
    Zoe "Hey...{w} That was pretty good!"
    Zoe "Not bad for a \"useless loser\" huh? "

    Tristan "H-hey...when did I call myself—"

    Zoe "You didn't have to...{p}I can read it in your eyes.."
    Zoe "..."
    Zoe "But i think you're wrong...hehe"

    "Zoe leans back, sipping her drink. Tristan stares at her for a moment longer, the lyrics of the song still echoing in his head."
    "..."
    "Suddenly Zoe jumped out from her seat"

    Zoe "Uwaaa… I forgot I have school tomorrow! Man that sucks! I was having a lot of fun."

    Tristan "Now that you said it… I have school tomorrow too."

    Zoe "Really? Which school do you go to?"

    Tristan "ARK-University."

    Zoe "NO WAY!! … we go to the same school then hehe!"

    "Tristan was shocked and speechless upon realizing they go to the same school."
    "He felt a sigh of relief, as if deep down he had been hoping for this."

    Zoe "Alright enough of that… let's make the most of today, your turn to pick my song. And no mercy!"

    "Tristan scrolls through the machine."
    "His eyes keep darting toward Zoe— {p}like a player glancing at a chessboard{p}unsure if the next move will win or lose the game."
