    "The warm afternoon sun spills over the park. Gentle wind carries the faint scent of flowers. Birds chirp as children run around laughing."

    "Tristan waits nervously in the park"

    Tristan "(In his head)  Why am I here?!"
    Tristan "(In his head)  Wait."
    Tristan "(In his head)  Wait..."
    Tristan "(In his head)  This is so sudden."
    Tristan "..."
    Tristan "(In his head)  A useless loser like me is on a date?"
    Tristan "(In his head)  Heck..."
    Tristan "(In his head)  Why did i even agree."
    Tristan "(In his head)  UGGHH!!!"
    Tristan "(In his head)  My head hurts..."

    #zoe shows up

    Zoe "Tristan Garcia, reporting late are we?"
    Zoe "*giggles* *giggles*"
    "Zoe hands him a dirnk"

    Tristan "H-Hey..."
    Tristan "You didn't have to get me this."

    Zoe "I wanted to!"
    Zoe "You looked like you'd melt if you sat here alone too long."

    #  *Television static fx* 

    Tristan "(In his head) That smile again..."
    Tristan "(In his head) Why does it feel like I've seen it a before"

    "Zoe notices his expression."

    Zoe "Headache again?"
    
    Tristan "N-no."
    Tristan "I'm fine, probably just the heat."

    Zoe "Hmm..."
    Zoe "If you sayo so."
    Zoe "..."
    Zoe "Come on.{w} Let's take a walk!"

    "They start walking along a shaded path lined with trees, their shadows overlapping on the pavement."

    Zoe "So..."
    Zoe "You have any hobbies?"
    Zoe "Don't say sleeping!"

    "Tristan, hesitant at first, but he felt that Zoe would understand"

    Tristan "I used to play chess..."

    Zoe "Used to?"
    Zoe "What happened?"
    Zoe "Hooo...{w} Did the king sue you?"

    Tristan "No..."
    Tristan "I just...{w} Stopped."
    Tristan "Lost interest...{w} I guess."

    Zoe "Such a Shame."
    Zoe "You probably would've crushed me in a match."

    Tristan "N-not really..."
    Tristan "I'm not that good."

    Zoe "Hah!"
    Zoe "You're just saying that so I'll underestimate you."

    "She nudges Tristan shoulder lightly."

    Zoe "..."
    Zoe "Well..."
    Zoe "Since you're stuck walking with me, you might as well learn something about me."
    
    Tristan "Yeah, honestly speaking..."

    Zoe "Because..."
    Zoe "Deep down...{w}You're curious."
    
    Tristan "M-maybe..."

    "She looks away briefly, her smile softening."

    Zoe "Let's just say...{w}I like doing thing I really want to do."

    Tristan "..."
    Tristan "That seems very vague."

    Zoe "Good."
    Zoe "I like being mysterious."

    #  *Television static fx* 

    Tristan "(In his head)  That again?!"
    Tristan "..."

    Zoe "Earth to Tristan!!!"

    Tristan "S-sorry..."
    Tristan "I just..."
    Tristan "You remind me of someone."

    Zoe "Hooo..."
    Zoe "An ex-girlfriend?"
    Zoe "Daydreaming of another when you have a real one here."

    Tristan "N-no!"
    Tristan "I mean..."
    Tristan "I don't...{w}It's just"

    "Zoe laughs, brushing it off, and starts walking again."

    Zoe "Alright, enough yapping. Race you to the ice cream stand!"
    Zoe "Loser has to pay"
    
    "Zoe bolted ahead"

    Tristan "Hey! No fair!"

    "Tristan showed a conflicted expression before he breaks into a small, genuine smile and chases after her."
