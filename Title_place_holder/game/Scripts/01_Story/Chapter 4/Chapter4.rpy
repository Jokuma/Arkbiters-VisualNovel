    Tristan "*grunts* I feel exhausted from last time… but it sure is fun." 

    Tristan "Well… I guess it's time to go to work."

    "A flicker of memory — {p}he remembers Zoe saying they both have the same school."

    Tristan "What if… {w}Nah, not a chance. {w}You shouldn't get my hopes up, Tristan."

    "Tristan then went to school and is now looking at the entrance."

    Tristan "It's been awhile since I last went here…"

    Tristan "I honestly can''t recall the last time I set foot in this university."

    Tristan "I don't even know what gave me the courage to go back here…"

    Tristan "What was the drive that made me go to this university anyway, was it really…"

    Tristan "Her?"

    #  *Television static fx* 

    Tristan "Ow! This stupid headache again…"

    Tristan "Welp, whatever the reason may be I am here anyways, so might as well…"

    "Afternoon sunlight spills through the tall hallway windows, painting golden streaks across the floor."
    "Students drift past in pairs and groups, chatting as they leave for the day."

    Tristan "(in his head) Knew it...{w} didn't see her all day."

    "The bell rings.{p}Steps out of the classroom, adjusting his bag strap."
    "As he turns the corner—"

    "???" "Tristan?"

    "Tristan stops."
    "Standing in front of him is Emil Navarro{p}taller than before{p}his expression somewhere between relief and frustration."

    Tristan "…Emil."

    Emil "Man, it's really you."
    Emil "I thought you dropped off the face of the earth."

    Tristan "Been...{w}busy."
    Emil "*sighs*{w} Busy, huh?"
    Emil "I've been checking every tournament list for months. Your name's never there."

    Tristan "...{w}Guess I moved on."

    Emil "Moved on?!" 
    Emil "Tristan...{w}you love the game.{p}You fought for every piece on the board."
    Emil "What happened to you?!"

    #  *Television static fx* 

    Tristan "..."

    Emil "Would you say something!"

    Tristan "Like I said…{w}I moved on!"

    Emil "Don't give me that answer...{w}We both know you love chess."
    Emil "As your rival I won't allow this!"

    #  *Television static fx* 

    "Emil grabs Tristan by the collar."

    Emil "As your frien...{w}I won't allow this!"

    "The air feels tense and heavy…"

    Zoe "(in her head) Is that Tristan's voice?"
    Zoe "I don't doubt that monotonous voice hehehe."
    Zoe "Yo Tristan!"
    Zoe "Zoe Gonzales is reporting for du-"

    "Zoeis shocked at the scene in front of her."
    "Tristan and Emil glanced over Zoe's direction."

    Tristan "Oh… perfect timing. Want to go home together?"

    "Zoe is still in shock."

    Zoe "U-hmm… yes, let's go together."

    "She says reluctantly."

    "Emillets go of Tristan...{p}Tristan slowly walks toward Zoe."

    Emil "I...{w}I did not mean to-"

    Tristan "It's okay...{p}I'm all out of pieces{p}my king is cornered."
    Tristan "I resign...{w}I quit chess."

    "Emil felt guilt, frustration, and hopelessness as Tristan utters those words."

    "A rival without adversary — {p}A lone king on an empty board{p}Every square a silent grave where knights once leapt and queens once danced{p}Now only the ticking clock remains, making moves for no one."

    Zoe "What happened...{w}Tristan?"

    Tristan "It's nothing...{w}just a little bit of catching up with an old friend."

    Zoe "Well, if you say so..."

    "Zoe casts suspicion and doubt on the words Tristan said"

    Zoe "I have an idea..."
    Zoe "hehe."
