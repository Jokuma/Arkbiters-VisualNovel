    "The faint smell of grilled street food, burnt sugar, and engine oil mixes into a strangely comforting haze."
    "The music from the rides is tinny, slightly warped by old speakers, but the laughter of children cuts through crisp and bright."

    Zoe "Come one Tristan!!"
    Zoe "It's been years since I've been to one of these."

    "She tugs his sleeve like a child dragging a reluctant parent into a toy store."

    Tristan "Years?{w} I can't remember the last time I went either..."
    Tristan "(quietly)  Feels like another lifetime."
    
    "They pass rows of booths—ring toss...{p}Balloon darts...{p}The shaky old Ferris wheel that creaks like it's telling ghost stories to the wind."
    "The perya is alive, but not spotless."
    "There's something imperfect about it..."
    "As if every stall is a little chipped, every prize a little faded."
    
    Zoe "First stop, darts!{w} Loser buys isaw."
    
    Tristan "That's...{w} an oddly specific bet."

    "They step up to the dart booth. A man with a cigarette hanging from his lips hands them three dull-looking darts each."
    "Zoe throws first—one balloon pops instantly."
    "She smirks."
    "Tristan throws, his first dart landing just shy of the target."
    "e exhales, steadying his hand like a chess player hovering over a piece before committing to the move."

    Zoe "You're overthinking it...{w} It's not chess Tristan."

    Tristan "Everything's chess of you stare long enough"

    "By the end, Zoe wins by a single balloon."
    "She cheers, and Tristan hands the vendor a few bills."
    "Soon, they're walking away with skewers of sizzling isaw{p}the smoky aroma wrapping around them like a blanket."

    Zoe "Man...{w} That was sooo fun!"
    Zoe "But so tiring! hehe"
    Zoe  "*cough* *cough*"

    "Tristan's smile fades..."
    "He chews slowly, as if the question itself takes time to digest."

    Tristan "Just...{w} thinking about some stuff."

    Zoe "bzzt...{w} Wrong answer!"

    Tristan "Huh?!"

    Zoe "I bought you here to have fun and take your mind off of things."

    Tristan "What the heck?...{w}HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"

    "Tristan laugh showing full expression and laughter"

    Zoe "Hey...{w} Why you laughing?"

    "Zoe smiled back...{p}This is the first time She saw Tristan really and genuinely smile"

    Zoe "That's the spirit!!!{w}...{w} *cough* *cough*"

    "As Zoe shouted she coughed again… this time it looked worse than usual"

    Tristan "You okay Zoe?"

    Zoe "More okay than you.{p}HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"

    "Tristan is worried but still put up a little smile"

    Tristan "It's fine...{w} if you're happy{w} then it's all fine"

    # Television static fx — 

    Zoe "hmm??{w} What did you say?"

    Tristan "nothing...{w} hehe"

    Zoe "Hooo...{w} So you're taking revenge on me"

    "Zoe uses punch on Tristan"
    "..."
    "Its Super Effective!"

    #fade transition siguro dito

    "While the both of them were strolling around the fare, Tristan stumbled upon 2 people having an intense chess match..."

    Chessplayer1 "Check!"

    Chessplayer2 "What?!{w} I did not see that move! What the hecl?!"

    Chessplayer1 "Well... Better look closer or you're going to lose in jsut a few moves"

    Chessplayer2 "Not gonna lie..{w} You're so good at this game{p} i don't even know if you're joking anymore."

    Chessplayer1 "hehehe."

    Tristan "(In his head){p}Looking at this match...{w}reminds me of what Emil said about me in school the other day…"

    # Flashback to when that interaction happened between Tristan and Emil

    "Zoe and Tristan then proceed to conclude their perya date and are heading to the park..."
