    Tristan "Zoe?!"

    Zoe "Hmm?"
    Zoe "..."
    Zoe "How did you know my name?"

    Tristan "(In his head){p}Why did I say that name?.."
    
    "A stream of tears falls down on the side of Tristan's face"

    Zoe "Ehhh!?"
    Zoe "..."
    Zoe "Did I said something wrong?{p}... oh no!"    

    Tristan "Oh sorry..."
    Tristan "You looked like someone from the manga I read"

    Zoe "Oh really? ...{w} hmmmh..."

    "Zoe laughs hard as if he is mocking Tristan."

    Zoe "Zoe Gonzales reporting in!"
    Zoe "Hehehe."
    Zoe "Pleasure meeting you Tristan."

    "As Zoe was about to leave Tristan shouted and stopped her"

    Tristan "Zoe!"
    Tristan "Say...{w}uhmm..."
    Tristan "do you want to go on a date?"

    Zoe "eh?"
    Zoe "eh?!?" with hpunch
    Zoe "EHHHHH!?!?" with hpunch

    "Same park. Same golden sunlight through the leaves."

    Zoe "Reporting late again, Tristan Garcia?"
    Zoe "*giggles* *giggles*"
    
    Tristan "Hey! at least I showed up"

    "They walk, talk, laugh. For him, this feels like one of many easy afternoons."

    Zoe "You shocked me..."
    Zoe "I was just about to ask you if you want to go on a date, you beat me right to it"

    Tristan "T-The words just came right out of my mouth for some reason"

    Zoe "And for that..."
    Zoe "Let's race to the ice cream truck!{p}Losers pay the other"
    Zoe "Bleh!!!"

    "Zoe rushes to the truck leaving Tristan"

    Tristan "Hey no fair!!!"

    # transition dito siguro

    "As days go by..."
    # karaoke bg
    "They went to the karaoke booth ang sang their hearts out..."
    # show School hallway bg
    "Tristan decided to go to school after knowing that Zoe also goes to the same one"
    "What greeted him was not Zoe...{w} But his old chess rival-Emil Navaro"

    #Transition ulitt bakushin!!!

    "The faint smell of grilled street food, burnt sugar, and engine oil mixes into a strangely comforting haze."
    "The music from the rides is tinny, slightly warped by old speakers{p}the laughter of children cuts through crisp and bright."

    Zoe "Come on, Tristan!"
    Zoe "It's been years since I've been to one of these."

    "She tugs his sleeve like a child dragging a reluctant parent into a toy store."

    Tristan "Years?{w}I can't remember the last time I went either."
    Tristan "(Quietly){p}Feels like another lifetime"

    "They pass rows of booths—ring toss...{p}Balloon darts...{p}The shaky old Ferris wheel that creaks like it's telling ghost stories to the wind."
    "The perya is alive, but not spotless."
    "There's something imperfect about it..."
    "As if every stall is a little chipped, every prize a little faded."

    Zoe "First stop...{w}Darts!"
    Zoe "Loser buys Kwek-kwek"

    Tristan "That's...{w} an oddly specific bet."

    "By the end, Tristan wins by a single balloon.{p}Zoe hands the vendor a few bills."
    "Soon, they're walking away with skewers of kwek-kwek, the fried aroma wrapping around them like a blanket."

    Zoe "Waahhh..."
    Zoe "No fair... Just a single balloon!!"

    "Tristan smuggly smirks"

    Zoe "Don't give me that look!!"
    Zoe "...."
    Zoe " What the heck?! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA"

    "Zoe burst out laughing… followed by Tristan who drops his smug look and joins laughing."
    
    Zoe "*Cough* *Cough* *Cough*"

    Tristan "You okay Zoe? That's one nasty cough"

    Zoe "More okay than you BWAHAHAHAHAHA"
    Zoe "Dont worry about me..."
    Zoe "Besides...{w} I brought you here to have fun--"
    #   [ Television static fx ]
    Tristan "Zoe..."
    Tristan "..."
    Tristan "You have an illness...{w} Don't you?"

    Zoe "hm?...{w} What do you mean?"
    Zoe "I'm perfectlu in tip top shape!"
    # [ Television static fx ]

    Tristan "Stop hiding it..."
    Tristan "Everytime we go on a date..."
    Tristan "You are struggling breathe or even move sometimes."
    Tristan "...{w} Don't shrug it off."
    Tristan "Please..."
    Tristan "Please......"
    # [ Television static fx ]
    Tristan "Tell me the truth"

    Zoe "bzztt no fair"
    Zoe "..."
    Zoe "What a a bad sport"

    "As she said those words...{w} Tears came flowing down."

    Zoe "H-How...{w} How did you find--"
    # [ Television static fx ]
    Zoe "What's that pain...{w} What's that noise"

    Tristan "It's that same feeling again...{w} You're feeling it too?"
    # [ Television static fx ]

    Zoe "It hurts!"
    # [ Television static fx ]
    Tristan "Zoe!!"
    # [ Television static fx ]
    Zoe "Tristan!...{w} I'm scared"
    # [ long Television static fx ]

    Zoe "Earth to mister...{w} Earth to mister!!"
    Zoe "Earth to mister..."
    Zoe "..."
    Zoe "T-Tristan?"

    Tristan "Z-Zoe?"

    # [ Television static fx ]

    Zoe "What is happening... That noise again"

    "The random noise and pain shows up frequently...{p} The both of them don't know what's happening and what's causing it.."
    "Suddenly...{p} The ground shakes."
    "The surrounding area of Tristan and Zoe began to disappear.{p}It's almost like the squares of the chess board are slowly falling apart one by one"

    Tristan "Zoe!...{w} Grab my Hand!!!"
    # [ Television static fx ]

    "The world is gone."
    "No streetlights, no park benches— just an endless black void with faint, drifting squares of white and gray floating like broken pieces of a chessboard."
    "Zoe is gripping Tristan's hand so tightly her knuckles turn pale"

    Zoe "Where...{w}where are we"

    Tristan "I've...{w} seen this place before."

    "The squares fall away into the dark{p}like pawns swept off the board by an unseen hand{p}In the distance, a faint ticking sound echoes — deliberate, cold, mechanical."

    Zoe "Tristan...{w} I'm scared"

    "He looks at her..."
    " he's trembling — not from the cold, but from something deeper{p}Her breaths are short, strained, like every inhale is borrowed time"

    #siguro dito like monologe yung wala nayung dialogue box muna tas yung text nasa gitna
    #[Flashback – Countless Loops]
    #Rapid, fragmented images tear through Tristan’s mind:
    #Zoe laughing in the park.
    #Zoe coughing in the karaoke booth.
    #Zoe Winning at the Perya
    #Tristan's fight in the hallway.
    #The same conversation, the same tears… repeated hundreds of times.

    "Tristan's grip loosens...{p}His eyes are wide, but no longer frantic."

    Tristan "...{w}I remember it now"

    Zoe "Remember what?"

    "He swallows hard. The void feels heavier, as if the unseen ticking is pressing against his chest."

    Tristan "We've been here before...{p}We've done this before{p}So many times..."
    Tristan "I...{w}Thought if I changed something..."
    Tristan "If I made a different choice..."
    Tristan "I could save you."

    # [ Television static fx ]

    Zoe "...{w} I remember it now too."

    "A tear slips down his cheek"

    Tristan "And I can't"

    "She blinks.{p}Then, softly, she smiles — not the bright, teasing grin from the park, but a fragile one{p}like she's been waiting for him to say it."

    Zoe "So...{w}This is really it?"
    Zoe "At least i got to complete my bucket list... hehe"

    Tristan "Liar...{w} You forgot one"

    "He pulls her close, holding her as if the void itself will have to pry her from his arms."

    Zoe "Buzztt! You are wrong hehe... "   
    Zoe "Even if i am gone...{p} I'm still here...{p} In your heart"
    Zoe "Just like in chess right?{p}Even if a piece is taken...{p}It's on the side watching other pieces moving."

    "Tristan loud cry echoes in the endless void they are in"
    "Zoe exhales — a slow, shaky breath — and rests her head against his chest."

    # [ Television static fx ]
    # The screen floods with harsh white noise. T

    "Zoe pushes away from Tristan..."

    Zoe "Thank you... Tristan."
    Zoe "Sorry for being selfish..."
    Zoe "..."
    Zoe "bye-bye"
    Zoe "..."
    Zoe "Checkmate!"
    #[ Final Television static fx ]
    #cut to white.. i think??


    #*montage style*
    "Months pass..."
    "The seasons change{p}squares of light and shadow shifting across the city."
    "Tristan visits the park — the same square where the game had begun."
    "Sometimes he stops at the perya{p}buys kwek-kwek and isaw, and leaves half on the bench beside him{p}as if saving it for a missing piece."
    "When people ask about Zoe...{w}he doesn't speak of the loss."
    "He tells them of her daring move...{p}her sharp laughter...{p}the way she'd tilt the game in her favor with a single smile."
    "Some nights, when the room is quiet and the pieces rest in still formation, he almost hears it —"
    "A soft, teasing voice across the board"
    
    "Checkmate."
