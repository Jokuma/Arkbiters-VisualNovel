    #-------------------SCENE 1: GYM-------------------

    "Tristan stood at the edge of the crowded gymnasium, heart pounding. After hearing Zoe's encouraging words, he had finally built up the courage to play again."

    "As he entered, Emil's eyes widened in surprise."

    Emil "Tristan? You're really here."

    Tristan "Yeah… and Emil, about what happened before… I'm sorry."

    "Emil shrugged and smirked."

    Emil "If you're really sorry… beat me in chess."

    "As the tournament goes on… Emil and Tristan climbs through the ranks and faced each other in the final round"

    "The two sat across the board, the crowd buzzing around them. Pieces clicked, clocks ticked, and tension filled the room."

    #Chess Minigame // The Evergreen Game

    #over speaker ----
    Commentator "Checkmate! Tristan wins the tournament!"
    #----------

    "Overwhelmed with joy, Tristan looked around the crowd to find Zoe… but she was nowhere."

    "After nearly an hour of searching, frustration grew."

    #[Television static fx]

    "Tristan thought back to the park — their first date — as night fell."

    #-------------------SCENE 2: PARK-------------------

    "Zoe sat quietly on the worn wooden bench, the dark playground stretching before her like a silent witness. The faint rustle of leaves whispered in the cold night air, and distant streetlights cast long, shaky shadows. She didn't look at Tristan when he approached—her gaze fixed on the empty swings swaying gently in the breeze."

    #Tristan (voice soft, tentative):
    
    Tristan "There you are! Why did you leave the gym? Why come here, all alone?"

    "Zoe's lips trembled, but her voice was barely more than a fragile whisper."

    Zoe "I guess i have to tell you the truth now hehe {w} *cough* *cough*" #said sadly

    "Her words hung in the air, heavy and fragile like glass about to shatter. Tristan's breath caught in his throat."

    #Tristan (voice tembling):

    Tristan "What… what do you mean?"

    "Zoe slowly turned to him, tears swelling up in her eyes but not falling... {w} yet."

    Zoe "I have been a selfish girl"

    "For a moment, everything went silent except the pounding of Tristan's heart—louder than anything else in the world."

    "His smile faded, cracking like ice underfoot. His hands clenched into fists, but the world felt too heavy to move."

    #Tristan (voice tembling):

    Tristan "Y-y-you are not making any sense!"

    #Zoe voice breaking:

    Zoe "I tried to run away so you don't see me like this… Every time we play, I beat you… I guess i can't beat you in a simple game of hide and seek hehe"

    #[Television static fx]

    "Tears spilled over Zoe's cheeks, glistening like fragile diamonds in the dim light. Yet through the sorrow, she managed a small, bittersweet smile—a smile filled with both gratitude and farewell."

    #Zoe Whispers, Barely Audible

    Zoe "Thank you… for everything. For the laughter, the dreams, the moments I never thought I'd have. Because of you… I got to cross off my bucket list."

    #Tristan (voice trembling):

    Tristan "wait..."

    "Her voice trembled with emotion, as if speaking these words used the last of her strength."

    #[Television static fx — rising, wavering]

    "Zoe's eyes searched Tristan's, desperate to leave something behind, some piece of herself in the moment they shared."

    #Zoe (barely a breath):

    Zoe "I love you."

    #Tristan (voice trembling):

    Tristan "wait..."

    #[Television static fx — fading slowly into silence]
    #Cuts to Black

    "*cough* {w} *cough*"

    "*Loud Thud sound*"

    #-------------------SCENE 3: HOSPITAL-------------------

    Tristan "What is happening… {w} Am I dreaming?"

    "Tristan is in shock… not really understanding everything"

    Tristan "Why..."

    "Whilst Tristan is thinking about the past events that may cause what happened"

    "He tried to approach the room where Zoe is but he is not permitted it only added more anxiety and fear to him."

    "Seconds passed… {p} Minutes passed… {p} Hours passed…"

    "Suddenly, Tristan saw some doctors and nurses running through the halls… He realized they are running towards the same direction where Zoe's room is"

    "Panicked, he rushed over to see if they are going to Zoe's room"

    "As he came closer… he saw a crowd of panicked nurses and doctors around Zoe's room."

    Tristan "\"please… please…\" he said whilst panting"

    "Some of the nurses blocked Tristan from going further"

    "Tristan pushes through and disregarded the heeds of the nurses"

    "As he looks into the room…"

    #[Flat line sounds]

    "Tristan stopped"

    #[Television static fx —]

    Doctor "Time of death-"

    #-------------------SCENE 4: PARK-NIGHT-------------------

    #*Cut to Tristan sitting on the bench at the park*

    "Tristan lost in his thoughts… showing nothing but the face of a mannequin, emotionless… empty."

    "As he looked down… he saw a piece of paper…"

    "As he finishes unfolding a paper…"

    #*show a picture of Zoe’s bucket list with all check marks except one… “To live together with Tristan ”*

    "Tears came flowing down"

    #[Television static fx —]

    #Tristan (voice trembling):

    Tristan "I keep thinking back… to all those moments with her."

    Tristan "The times she smiled… the times she looked at me like I mattered."
    
    Tristan "And I… I just took it for granted."

    Tristan "I thought… there would always be more time."

    Tristan "But time… just slipped away before I even realized it."

    #clenches his fists

    Tristan "I didn't listen closely enough… I didn't see the signs."

    Tristan "And now… all I'm left with is this emptiness, this ache that won't go away."
    
    Tristan "What I regret most of all is that I didn't even get to confess to her properly"

    Tristan "I didn't even get the chance to say those words to her yet…"

    Tristan "I didn't even get to say…"

    Tristan "..."

    Tristan "I love you…"

    Tristan "ughhh why didn't I notice sooner!!! Why am I feeling this way again!!!"
    
    Tristan "if only i knew… if only i was there for her"

    Tristan "if..."

    Tristan "if……"

    Tristan "……"

    "Tristan Looks up… hearing a familiar voice."

    Tristan "eh?"
