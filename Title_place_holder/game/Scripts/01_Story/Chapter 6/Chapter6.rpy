    "The sun was setting, the sky was orange, and the perya was drawing to a close."

    "After a fun date, Zoe and Tristan sat on a nearby bench for a little breather…"

    Zoe "Wow! Today was so fun~! I haven't had this much fun in awhile!"

    Tristan "Yeah I agree…"

    "Tristan looking a bit gloomy remembering the chess match from the perya previously"

    Zoe "Hey, what's wrong? Is there something on your mind?"

    Tristan "Zoe I have a question… Is there something that you really love to do but you're too afraid to face it head on because of the outcome?"

    Zoe "What made you ask?"

    Tristan "Well... ever since I was a kid... I've been in love with chess."

    Tristan "I remember spending most of my childhood days just trying to get better…"

    Tristan "It sounds kinda silly now… but back then, chess wasn't just a game. It was my reason to get up in the morning. My escape. My purpose."

    Tristan "You know? like, chess kinda became part of my life, it gave me the reason to keep looking forward."

    Tristan "Then I got good enough to be able to  join tournaments… I was really nervous at first but when I got my first win ever I was thrilled… It was the best feeling ever…"

    Tristan "Heh, it was kinda funny that some even go as far to say that I am a child prodigy…"

    CrowdM "\"He should've won that match what a waste\""

    CrowdF "\Do you think he has gotten worse?\""

    CrowdM "\"Maybe he wasn't the child prodigy people were hyping him up to be…\""

    Tristan "That moment… It stuck with me. Like a stain I couldn't wash off. I swore I'd never let myself feel that kind of shame again."

    Tristan "I tried to keep going, but the passion that once burned so bright… it just kept fading. Every game felt heavier. Every move felt wrong. Until one day… I just stopped playing altogether."

    Tristan "Never thought I'd give up on the one thing that made me feel alive. But here I am… walking away from the only thing I ever thought I was good at…"

    Tristan "hahaha… {w} you might think I'm pretty pathetic letting something like failure bring me down so much…"

    Zoe "I don't think it's pathetic…"

    Zoe "Actually… there's something I really love to do too, and for a while… I stopped."

    Zoe "I told myself it was for the best… that maybe it was safer to just leave it behind. But you know what? That didn't make me happy. It only made me feel like I was losing a part of myself."

    Zoe "The truth is… you only get one life, Tristan. And if you love something, you shouldn't let fear take it away from you. Not pressure, not what people say, not even the chance of failing."

    Tristan "… {w} But what if I go through that pain again?"

    #High Impact Scene
    Zoe "Then you face it. {w} In chess and in life you can't win without moving a piece, fear of losing is just a check… {p} Your courage is the move that leads to checkmate."

    "She chuckles softly, leaning back on the bench."

    Zoe "If it's something that makes you feel alive… isn't it worth fighting for?"

    Zoe "Her smile lingers, but there's a quiet weight behind her words one Tristan doesn't notice yet."

    "Tristan's eyes light up and a little tear drop can be seen"

    Zoe "Hmmm~ {w} never thought Mister Tristan would show such an emotion I'm so shocked! hehe~"

    Tristan "Oh stop! I'm not crying! There's just something in my eye is'all"

    Zoe "Yeah sure that's what they all say hehe…"

    "Tristan looking a bit annoyed"

    Tristan "Hey Zoe thanks for the advice… It really helped clear things that are going through my mind…"

    Zoe "Yeah of course! I'm your girlfriend after all!"

    Tristan "..."

    Zoe "hehe~ did you just blushed just now~"

    Tristan "No I didn't! Stop!"

    "Zoe chuckles"

    Tristan "Anyway I'm thinking of entering this school year's chess tournament… I was wondering if you would like to watch?"

    Zoe "Sure! I would love to watch your match!"

    Tristan "That's great! The tournament starts at 3pm in the school gymnasium!"

    Zoe "I'll be there no matter what! Promise me a good match!"

    Tristan "Yeah, I promise to not disappoint!"

    # Maybe needs pauses
    
    Tristan "What is this feeling… This feels like something I haven't felt in a long time… Is this the feeling of… Happiness?"

    Tristan "This is the first time in a while since I felt like looking forward to something… I have Zoe to thank for that…"

    Tristan "I think my feelings are real… I think I've genuinely fallen for her…"

    Tristan "Now that I think about it… None of us actually confessed our love because it was so sudden…"

    Tristan "I think after the chess tournament I will confess to her…"

    # *static noise*

    Tristan "Ow! Am I really having a headache at this time… anyway… I need to prepare for the upcoming chess tournament! I can't disappoint Zoe at all costs!"
